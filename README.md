# Things I Do

## 🖥️ Software Engineering

As a software engineer, I've spent most of my professional life jumping in-between languages, stacks and frameworks depending on the objective. I tend to treat technology as a tool to accomplish a job and would call myself as a full stack generalist (if that's even a thing).

Most of my career was focused around fintech, crypto and web3 ranging from personal and client projects, startups and traditional companies. I've also spent some time as a product person. 

I also **really** like ☕
